# You can connect a second wifi dongle to the mower to:
# - A: Use a big antenna dongle to improve your home wifi signal.
# - B: Use a small & cheap dongle to only use for the hotspot
#
# For case A the wifi_device should be "wlan0"
#   (the hotspot uses the internal antenna)
# For case B the wifi_device should be "wlan1"
#   (the hotspot uses the usb dongle)

#primary_wifi_device: wlan0



# If applience_mode is set to true the hotspot stays open
# even if a wifi connection is established.
# In this mode clients connected to the AP will have full
# access to the other network connection.
